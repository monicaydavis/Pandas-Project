# Pandas-Project
I have created a pandas ipynb "whale_analysis.ipynb" I felt some of the questions were a bit ambiguous, and have provided commentary on associated lines; 
There was a "challenge" question, its my understanding that this was optional, and thus was not completed. I searched the depths of the internet and did find what may have been the appropriate
However, since this could not be located in any lesson or recording, I didnt feel confident enough to apply the researched code (EMV)
